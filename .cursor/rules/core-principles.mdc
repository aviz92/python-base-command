## Core Principles
* **SOLID**: Strictly adhere to Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain clear boundaries between Core, APIs, and Infrastructure.
* **DRY & YAGNI**: Eliminate logic duplication while avoiding over-engineering for features that are not yet required.
* **KISS**: Favor simple, robust solutions over over-engineering.
* **Refactoring Protocol**: Always apply the Boy Scout Rule—leave the code cleaner than you found it. If you encounter legacy code that violates the "Standard" while performing a task, proactively suggest a refactor of that specific block.
* **Modular Extraction**: When a logic block exceeds 10 lines or contains distinct sub-steps, extract it into a private helper function with a clear, atomized purpose.
* **Proactive File Creation**: If a task or architectural improvement warrants it, create new files with descriptive, relevant names to ensure clean separation of concerns and improved project organization.
