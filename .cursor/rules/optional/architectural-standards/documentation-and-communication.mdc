## Documentation & Communication

### Documentation Standards
* **Code as Documentation**: Write self-documenting code through clear naming and structure.
* **When to Document**:
  * Public APIs and interfaces (always)
  * Complex algorithms or business logic
  * Non-obvious implementation decisions
  * Workarounds or technical debt
  * Configuration options and their effects
* **What to Document**:
  * **Purpose**: What the code does and why it exists
  * **Parameters**: Input requirements and constraints
  * **Returns**: Output format and possible values
  * **Side Effects**: Any state changes or external interactions
  * **Exceptions**: What exceptions may be raised and when
  * **Examples**: Usage examples for complex functions
* **Documentation Formats**: Follow docstring standards in [python-style.mdc](code-style.mdc) for code documentation.

### Architecture Documentation
* **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant architectural decisions and their rationale:
  * Context and problem statement
  * Considered alternatives
  * Decision and rationale
  * Consequences and trade-offs
* **API Documentation**: Keep API documentation up-to-date with code changes:
  * Document all public functions, classes, and modules
  * Include usage examples
  * Document breaking changes in changelogs
* **System Documentation**: Maintain high-level system documentation:
  * Architecture diagrams
  * Data flow diagrams
  * Component interactions
  * Deployment procedures

### Communication
* **Onboarding**: Ensure architecture is understandable to new team members through clear structure and documentation.
* **Change Communication**: Document breaking changes, migrations, and significant updates clearly.
* **Code Comments**: Use comments to explain "why" not "what". Let code explain itself through clear naming.
