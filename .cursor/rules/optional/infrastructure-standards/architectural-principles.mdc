## Architectural Principles
* **Functional Simplicity**: Prefer direct, single-function solutions over complex abstractions or unnecessary helper layers.
* **Function Atomicity**: Every function must have exactly one purpose. Large functions must be decomposed into smaller, modular units to maximize simplicity and reusability.
* **Modularity**: Build infrastructure components to be reusable across different repositories and libraries.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Keep infrastructure code separate from application logic. Infrastructure should be a separate layer.
