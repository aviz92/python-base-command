## CI/CD Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
* **Fast Feedback**: Optimize pipelines for fast feedback. Run quick checks (linting, type checking) before expensive operations (tests, builds).
* **Parallelization**: Run independent jobs in parallel to reduce total pipeline time.
* **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching for dependencies, build artifacts, and intermediate results.
* **Artifact Management**: Store and version build artifacts appropriately. Clean up old artifacts to save storage.

### Pipeline Stages
* **Validation**: Run validation stages (linting, formatting, type checking) early in the pipeline.
* **Testing**: Execute tests in appropriate stages. Use test result reporting and artifact collection.
* **Building**: Build artifacts in a consistent, reproducible manner.
* **Deployment**: Use separate stages for different deployment targets (staging, production).

### Pipeline Configuration
* **Version Control**: Store CI/CD configuration in version control alongside application code.
* **Conditional Execution**: Use appropriate rules for when jobs should run (branches, tags, merge requests, schedules).
* **Job Dependencies**: Define clear job dependencies using `needs` or `depends_on` to ensure proper execution order.
* **Failure Handling**: Configure appropriate failure handling (allow_failure, retry logic, notifications).
