## Containerization & Orchestration

### Docker Best Practices
* **Multi-stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size.
* **Layer Caching**: Order Dockerfile instructions to maximize layer caching effectiveness.
* **Security**: Use minimal base images, scan for vulnerabilities, and run containers as non-root users.
* **Image Tagging**: Use semantic versioning and meaningful tags for container images.

### Container Management
* **Resource Limits**: Always define resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers.
* **Health Checks**: Implement health checks for long-running containers.
* **Logging**: Ensure containers output logs to stdout/stderr for proper log aggregation.
