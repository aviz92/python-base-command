## Infrastructure as Code

### Configuration Management
* **Declarative Syntax**: Prefer declarative configuration over imperative scripts.
* **Versioning**: Version all infrastructure code and configuration files.
* **Modularity**: Break down infrastructure code into reusable modules.
* **Documentation**: Document infrastructure architecture, dependencies, and deployment procedures.

### Tool Selection
* **Terraform**: Use for cloud infrastructure provisioning when appropriate.
* **Ansible/Chef/Puppet**: Use for configuration management and application deployment.
* **CloudFormation/CDK**: Use cloud-native IaC tools when working with specific cloud providers.
