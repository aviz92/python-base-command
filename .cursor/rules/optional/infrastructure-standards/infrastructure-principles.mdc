## Infrastructure Principles

### Core Philosophy
* **Idempotency**: All infrastructure operations must be idempotent. Running the same operation multiple times should produce the same result.
* **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure should be reproducible across environments. Use version-controlled configuration files.
* **Immutable Infrastructure**: Prefer immutable infrastructure patterns where possible. Rebuild rather than modify in place.
* **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure should be defined in code, version-controlled, and reviewed through the same process as application code.

### Environment Management
* **Environment Parity**: Maintain consistency between development, staging, and production environments.
* **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration. Never hardcode environment-specific values.
* **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret management systems. Never commit secrets to version control.
* **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration. Document all required variables. Follow environment variable standards in [env-setup.mdc](env-setup.mdc).
