## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging
* **Logging Library**: Use logging libraries as defined in [standard-libraries.mdc](standard-libraries.mdc).
* **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging formats (JSON) for better parsing and analysis.
* **Log Levels**: Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
* **Log Aggregation**: Centralize logs for analysis and alerting.

### Metrics & Alerting
* **Key Metrics**: Monitor key infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).
* **Application Metrics**: Track application-specific metrics (request rates, error rates, latency).
* **Alerting**: Set up appropriate alerts for critical issues. Avoid alert fatigue.
