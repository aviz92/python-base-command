## Security Best Practices

### Access Control
* **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions for all services and users.
* **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms. Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
* **Authorization**: Implement proper authorization checks at all access points.

### Security Scanning
* **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Container Scanning**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Secret Scanning**: Scan code repositories for accidentally committed secrets.
